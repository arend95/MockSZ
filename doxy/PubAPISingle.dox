\defgroup singlepointing Single-Pointings
\brief This section contains the public API methods available for generating single-pointing SZ signals.

These can be subdivided into obtaining the thermal SZ, non-thermal SZ and kinematic SZ signals.
In contrast to the cluster models, single-pointing models are called through a function-based interface, instead of the object-oriented interface for making extended SZ models.
